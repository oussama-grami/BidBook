**BidBooks** – *Book a book, give it a second look!*  
An AI-powered and auction-based second-hand book marketplace that redefines how people buy and sell used books. Our platform offers transparent pricing, intelligent suggestions, and real-time features for a seamless user experience.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

1. ❌ Lack of transparency in second-hand book pricing  
2. ❌ Difficulty in finding specific books  
3. ❌ Existing platforms are slow and unintuitive  

---

## ✅ Our Solution

### 📊 1. Smart Price Estimation
Users enter details about their book, and an AI model analyzes the data to estimate an optimal selling price.

### 🛒 2. Listing & Auction System
Once the seller accepts the price, the book is listed. When a buyer places a bid, a **24-hour auction** is triggered. The highest bidder at the end of this period wins the book.

### 💬 3. Fluid & Personalized Experience
- Real-time notifications  
- Built-in community space  
- Rating, comments, and user feedback features
